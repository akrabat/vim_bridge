Installation
------------
Simply install the [vim_py_bridge](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vim_py_bridge/)
Python package, using setuptools, `easy_install`, or `pip`.


Usage
-----
In a Vim script, decorate your Python functions as follows to expose them as
native Vim callables.  Both arguments and return values are casted so it should
be transparent:

    python << endpython
    from vim_bridge import bridged

    @bridged('first', 'last')
    def SayHello(first, last):
        return "Hello, %s %s!" % (first, last)

    endpython

    " Now call directly into the Python function!
    echo SayHello("John", "Doe")     " prints "Hello, John Doe!"


Supported
---------
The following data types have proven to work:

* Strings
* Integers
* Lists
* Exceptions


More examples
-------------
Passing in a list:

    python << endpython
    from vim_bridge import bridged

    @bridged('list')
    def GetLongest(list):
        return max(map(lambda s: len(s), list))

    endpython

    echo GetLongest(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'])  " returns "three"


Catching exceptions:

    python << endpython
    from vim_bridge import bridged

    @bridged()
    def WillCauseException():
        raise Exception("Oops")

    endpython

    echo WillCauseException()       " will throw an error to the user

    " but... here's how you deal with it in Vim
    try
        echo WillCauseException()       " will throw an error to the user
    catch
        echo "Something went wrong. Aborting."
    finally
        echo "Cleaning up."
    endtry
